Hello,
This is a base template for a discord.js discord bot.

If you DO NOT have a .env file please make one and call it ".env" and format it like this - TOKEN = "". Please put your discord bot token
after it says TOKEN. Make sure not to share this at any time to anyone.

You might need to install things before you get your bot running. So open a new terminal within the file in VS code (Or whatever code editor
your are using and run these command) v
Command1 - npm install discord.js
Command2 - npm install dotenv
Command3 - npm install ascii-table

To change the status of the bot please follow this path in this folder. Events > Client > ready.js. You will see more information on how to 
change the bots status there.

It is pretty simple from here. Have a look around and hope this makes it easier to get the basic core system for your discord js bot!

Any issues with the bot files feel free to drop me a DM on discord (DanBoi#6583). If you need any help with commands or the code a useful place
to start is by looking at the error online or asking other members in the discordjs discord server (https://discord.gg/djs).
